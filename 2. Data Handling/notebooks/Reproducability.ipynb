    "One of the core ideas of the Python language is its readability. Its creator believed that *Code is read more often than it is written*.\n",
    "\n",
    "You should fully assume that the same goes for your code. You yourself will read it again and again, maybe soon, maybe in a few months. Often, you'll share it with others, or others will find it.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Can they read, understand and run your code?\n",
    "\n",
    "In a research institute as Deltares, this is of added importance. Scientific research should be reproducable, so this will apply to your code as well.\n",

    "## Environments\n",
    "Different Python scripts or libraries often require different versions of packages. An example, Library A requires `GDAL==1.00` while Library B requires `GDAL>2.0`. If this happens you need a way to switch between the two GDAL versions, just as you sometimes need to switch between Python 2 and 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "The easiest way to switch between packages is to use __environments__. An environment is in essence a folder of Python packages. Anaconda, the Python package manager we're using, can easily switch between these.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use `conda env list` to list your environments. You probably will find only one, named `base`. The `*` indicates the active environment. All commands you execute (`conda install` or `python`) come from this `base` environment. We'll use the `!` command unique to a Jupyter notebook to execute a `cmd` command. Otherwise, please switch to a new `cmd` window."
